I, William Sawyer (46963608), hereby declare that this is my own original work,
and that no part of this assignment has been copied from any other source or person
except where due acknowledgement is made; no part of the work has been previously
submitted for assessment in this or any other institution except where explicitly
acknowledged; I have read PPL 3.60.04, UQâ€™s Student Integrity and Misconduct
Policy and understand its implications.

I use GitHub Copilot; however, typically only for boilerplate and documentation.
In the case of this assignment, as the API is provided, Copilot was only used for
writing docstrings for additional methods.

I did not use any other form of Generative AI.
