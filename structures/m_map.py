NOTE: This file will be used for marking.

Please read the following carefully. This file is used to implement a Map
class which supports efficient insertions, accesses, and deletions of
elements.

There is an Entry type defined in m_entry.py which *must* be used in your
map interface. The Entry is a very simple class that stores keys and values.
The special reason we make you use Entry types is because Entry extends the
Hashable class in m_util.py - by extending Hashable, you must implement
and use the `get_hash()` method inside Entry if you wish to use hashing to
implement your map. We *will* be assuming Entry types are used in your Map
implementation. Sorry for any inconvenience this causes (hopefully none!).
Note that if you opt to not use hashing, then you can simply override the
get_hash function to return -1 for example.
